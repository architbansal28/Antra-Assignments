1. Six combinations of access modifier keywords:
   - public: Accessible from anywhere.
   - private: Accessible only within the class.
   - protected: Accessible within the class and its derived classes.
   - internal: Accessible within the same assembly.
   - protected internal: Accessible within the same assembly or derived classes.
   - private protected: Accessible within the same class or derived classes within the same assembly.

2. Difference between static, const, and readonly:
   - static: Belongs to the type itself rather than an instance.
   - const: Compile-time constant, cannot be changed.
   - readonly: Runtime constant, can be assigned only during declaration or in the constructor.

3. Constructor: Initializes an object of a class.

4. partial keyword: Allows splitting the definition of a class, struct, or interface across multiple files.

5. Tuple: A data structure that holds a sequence of elements of different types.

6. record keyword: Defines a reference type that provides built-in functionality for encapsulating data.

7. Overloading vs Overriding:
   - Overloading: Multiple methods with the same name but different signatures.
   - Overriding: Providing a new implementation of a method in a derived class.

8. Field vs Property:
   - Field: A variable that holds data directly.
   - Property: A member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field.

9. Optional method parameter: Specify a default value in the method signature.

10. Interface vs Abstract class:
    - Interface: Defines a contract with no implementation.
    - Abstract class: Can provide both abstract (no implementation) and concrete methods (implementation).

11. Accessibility level of interface members: Public by default.

12. True. Polymorphism allows derived classes to provide different implementations of the same method.

13. True. The override keyword is used to indicate that a method in a derived class is providing its own implementation of a method.

14. False. The new keyword is used to hide a method in a base class, not to override it.

15. False. Abstract methods cannot be used in a non-abstract class.

16. True. Normal methods can be used in an abstract class.

17. True. Derived classes can override methods that were virtual in the base class.

18. True. Derived classes can override methods that were abstract in the base class.

19. False. In a derived class, you can override a method that was virtual or abstract in the base class, not a method that was neither.

20. False. A class that implements an interface must provide implementations for all members of the interface.

21. True. A class that implements an interface can have other members not defined in the interface.

22. False. A class can have only one base class.

23. True. A class can implement multiple interfaces.
